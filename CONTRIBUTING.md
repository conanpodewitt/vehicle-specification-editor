## Working locally

### Exectution

Because the application is packaged for PyPi, it may not be obvious how to execute the application from it's source code.   
If the requirements are met the GUI can be launch via running ``python3 -m vehicle_gui`` in the root directory of the repo \
It's advisable to run ``pip install .`` first as this will ensure you have the correct packages installed and that the pygment plugin is present.


### Debugging

To Debug the application, copy the `__main__.py` to the root of the repository. From this new `__main__` running any python debugger will produce the expected results. \
**Remember to remove or  the extra `__main__` before commiting**
